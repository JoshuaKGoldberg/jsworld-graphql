# JSWorld GraphQL Example

Example project showing two areas of code using [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com):

- `client/`:
- `server/`:

> This is heavily based off the [Apollo tutorial](https://apollographql.com/docs/tutorial/introduction.html). ðŸš€

## Usage

To run the app, run these commands in two separate terminal windows from the root:

```shell
cd server && npm i && npm start
```

and

```shell
cd client && npm i && npm start
```
